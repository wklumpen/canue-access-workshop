    "# Generating Transit Travel Times with r5py\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to calculate access to opportunities, we need to generate transit (or other mode) travel times.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a generally computationally intensive process, and has been the main technical hurdle to overcome in this process.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workbook, we are going to generate transit travel times using a relativley new Python library `r5py`. R5py is designed to allow Python users to access the open-source R5 engine, a powerful engine that is the spiritual successort to OpenTripPlanner. You can ready more about r5py via [their documentation](https://r5py.readthedocs.io), or check out [R5's own github page](https://github.com/conveyal/r5).\n",
    "In this workbook we are going to generate transit travel time using the Python library r5py.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example analysis, we want to answer two questions:\n",
    "- How is the access to hospitals distributed across different populations?\n",
    "- How is the access to child care spaces distributed across different populations?\n",
    "- How does peak-period and evening service change this access for various populations?\n",
    "\n",
    "For this we need to generate *two* travel time matrices. One for a peak period (7-9am) and for an evening period (9-11pm).\n",
    "\n",
    "The beauty of the R5 engine is that it allows us to measure a median peak-period value very easily. To do this, we start our analysis at the beginning of our specified time period (7am and 9pm) and set the duration of the analysis to 120 minutes to cover our 2-hour period.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting Up Data\n",
    "The first thing we need to do is set up our workbook and data so we can easily run a travel time matrix. To do an analysis we need *origin* and *destination* points. In our case, we are going to keep the calculations relatively minimal by mapping the following origin -> destination travel times:\n",
    "- Dissemination area centroids -> Hospitals\n",
    "- Dissemination area centroids -> Child care locations\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by loading the appropriate data and setting some key settings for R5py. One little quirk we are going to need is that R5py requires our origin/destination points to be named `id`, not anything else like `dauid`. We'll make that change now."

The transport network needs both an underlying OpenStreetMap PBF file as well as one or more GTFS feeds.
