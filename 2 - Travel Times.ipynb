    "# Generating Transit Travel Times with r5py\n",
    "In this workbook we are going to generate transit travel time using the Python library r5py.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example analysis, we are interested in answering the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How is the access to hospitals distributed across different populations?\n",
    "- How is the access to child care spaces distributed across different populations?\n",
    "- How does peak-period and evening service change this access for various populations?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question, we need to generate *two* travel time matrices. One for a peak period (7-9am) and for an evening period (9-11pm).\n",
    "\n",
    "The beauty of the R5 engine is that it allows us to measure a median peak-period value very easily. To do this, we start our analysis at the beginning of our specified time period (7am and 9pm) and set the duration of the analysis to 120 minutes to cover our 2-hour period.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting Up Data\n",
    "The first thing we need to do is set up our workbook and data so we can easily run a travel time matrix. To do an analysis we need *origin* and *destination* points. In our case, we are going to keep the calculations relatively minimal by mapping the following origin->destination travel times:\n",
    "- Dissemination area centroids -> Hospitals\n",
    "- Dissemination area centroids -> Child care locations\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by loading the appropriate data and setting some key settings for R5py. One little quirk we are going to need is that R5py requires our origin/destination points to be named `id`, not anything else like `dauid`. We'll make that change now."
